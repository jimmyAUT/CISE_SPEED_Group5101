SPEED is for empirical evidence in software practice.
Explore articles, suggest new ones, and search for valuable insights.

Workflow and roles
Three main activities that the SPEED product needs to support are: finding suitable articles, extracting the appropriate information from them, and entering them into the SPEED database. 
(Moderators) will moderate the article for quality and non-duplication. If it passes the moderation process the article is then read and analysed by staff at (Analysts) and the relevant information extracted from the article and entered into the SPEED database.

Finding articles
Anyone can suggest an article to include in the SPEED database. A Submitter will submit the bibliographic details only (NOT the pdf) of a published study they want to suggest should be included in SPEED (e.g. Title, authors, journal name, year of publication, volume, number, pages, DOI).

Moderation of Articles
Submitted articles will go into a queue in SPEED for the SERC moderator to do a quality check. The moderator should be notified by SPEED if there are any articles waiting in the queue. The moderator will then retrieve the list of articles in the queue awaiting moderation. They can then check that each article in the submitted queue is not already in SPEED or has not been rejected previously. 

Analysis of Articles
Articles that get passed by the Moderator will go into another queue ready for the Analyst to work on. Rejected papers go into a rejected papers database. The analyst is notified if there are any papers in the queue ready for analysis. The submitter is notified of the outcome of the moderation (accept or reject).

The SERC analyst will analyse each of the papers in the analysis queue and extract the appropriate information from the articles and enter it into SPEED. The bibliographic information should be automatically transferred to SPEED from the information the submitter submitted.
